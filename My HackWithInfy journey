My HackWithInfy Journey 🚀

How I First Heard About HackWithInfy
I first heard about HackWithInfy from my college professor. He explained that it is a national-level coding challenge conducted by Infosys, offering two major roles:
->DSE (Digital Specialist Engineer)
->SP (Special Programmer)

What excited me the most was the SP role, which offers a 9.5 LPA package. From that moment, I decided that I would give my best to qualify this competitive exam.


My Preparation Strategy
From the very next day, I started my preparation seriously.
I was already solving DSA problems daily, so my main focus was:
Revising core topics like Arrays, Binary Trees, and Graphs
Strengthening fundamental CS concepts
However, I realized that I had never studied Dynamic Programming properly, so I had to start learning it from the basics.
After 3–4 days, I filled out the HackWithInfy application form.


Daily Routine
Solved 4–6 DSA problems daily
Spent 1–2 hours on fundamentals like:
OOPS
MySQL
Databases
Studied 6–8 hours daily for around 20–25 days




Exam Day Experience
On the exam day, I felt very nervous. Many questions were running through my mind:
Will I perform well?
Will I get selected for DSE or SP?
The exam duration was 3 hours.
I was able to solve around 2.5 questions.
One question I remember clearly was related to a stairs/ladder problem, where I could not pass all the test cases.


Waiting for the Results
The next day, I discussed the exam with my friends. Some of them said they solved all the questions, which honestly made me feel a bit demotivated.
After around 20 days, the results were announced. Only 44 students were selected nationwide.
At that time, I was in my hometown and hadn’t checked the results. Suddenly, one of my friends called me and said:
“You got selected in HackWithInfy!”
That moment was pure happiness for me.


Technical & Interview Round
After 15 days, Infosys scheduled the Technical and Interview rounds.
I was shortlisted for the DSE role.



Technical Round
Time: 30 minutes
Task: Solve 1 problem out of 2
Here, I made a major mistake:
I spent too much time thinking
I developed the correct logic
But while implementing the solution, time ran out
At that moment, I felt that I might lose this opportunity.


Interview Round
After the technical round, I went for the interview.
The interviewer asked:
Why I couldn’t complete the coding problem
→ I explained my approach clearly
Short self-introduction
Difference between Java and Python
Difference between List and Tuple
A few personal questions
I answered everything confidently.
At the end, he said “Thank you”, and the interview ended.


Final Result
When the final result was announced, I found that my name was not on the selected list.
Although I was disappointed, this journey taught me:
The importance of time management
The need to practice coding under pressure
That communication matters as much as logic



What This Journey Gave Me

Even though I didn’t get selected in the final round, HackWithInfy:
Improved my problem-solving skills
Gave me real interview experience
Helped me identify my weaknesses
Made me more confident for future opportunities
